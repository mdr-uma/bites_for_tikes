# Bites for Tikes

This rails portfolio app is build for busy parents who don't have time to plan meals for their kids everyday. This app will provide a chart, where they can plan their meals(breakfast, lunch & dinner) in advance for a whole week. They can sign up, login, log out, create a chart, add, update and delete the meals they created. I will be more than happy if this will make your life little easier. Enjoy!
